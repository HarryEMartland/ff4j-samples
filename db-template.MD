The [Apache Cassandra](target) database is the right choice when you need scalability 
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven 
fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform 
for mission-critical data.Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is 
best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that 
you can survive regional outages.
